            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, my name is Om from Mumbai. I am a full-time Developer and a part-time Videographer.</p>
            <p>I have good knowledge in the tech world and social media. I'm currently working with a content creator
                who has over 200k subscribers on
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@HastarLive" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
            </p>
            <p>I'm passionate about web development and continuously improving my skills in Web Development.
                I'm also exploring content creation, videography, and photo editing to express creativity.</p>
            <p>Coming from a background rooted in nature, I also have hands-on experience in farming — understanding
                soil, crop care, and the hard work that goes behind real growth. It keeps me grounded.</p>
            <p>Beyond tech, I'm focused on personal growth — building confidence, emotional intelligence, and
                communication skills.</p>
